        <h1>Directions</h1>
        <p> <strong>Step 1</strong> </p>
        <p>
            Cook Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.
        </p>
        <p> <strong>Step 2</strong> </p>
        <p>
            Cook bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings with the bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven. Stir in onions and garlic; cook until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
        </p>
        <p> <strong>Step 3</strong> </p>
        <p>
            Stir in chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Add potatoes and simmer until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; stir in cream, cooked sausage, and spinach. Cook and stir until spinach has wilted and sausage is warmed through; serve.
